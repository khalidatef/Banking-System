## 🎯 **Key Conflict Resolutions**

### **1. User Interface Conflicts** ✅
- **Problem**: Old User interface had `userName`, new has `username`
- **Solution**: Updated all components to use new User from mock-users.ts
- **Impact**: Zero merge conflicts on user property access

### **2. Role Enum Conflicts** ✅
- **Problem**: Old UserRole enum vs new Role enum
- **Solution**: Replaced all UserRole references with Role enum
- **Impact**: Consistent role checking across entire application

### **3. Authentication Method Conflicts** ✅
- **Problem**: Your async login() vs team's synchronous login()
- **Solution**: Implemented team's sync method while preserving your improvements
- **Impact**: Perfect compatibility with team's auth flow

### **4. Guard Implementation Conflicts** ✅
- **Problem**: Class-based AuthGuard vs functional roleGuard
- **Solution**: Converted to modern functional guard pattern
- **Impact**: Follows team's modern Angular patterns

### **5. Model Export Conflicts** ✅
- **Problem**: Duplicate Account/Transaction exports causing compilation errors
- **Solution**: Used explicit named exports to resolve ambiguity
- **Impact**: Clean compilation with backward compatibility

### **6. ID Type Conflicts** ✅
- **Problem**: String IDs in mock-users vs number IDs in services
- **Solution**: Added type conversion where needed
- **Impact**: Seamless integration between user data and services
